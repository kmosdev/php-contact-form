php-contact-form
================

A php based contact form with js validation and optional submission logging.

This script uses the phpmailer class and jquery based h5validate plugin.

It uses PDO with sqlite for the submission log.

It has a honeypot spam prevention built in. You can pretty easily add other spam checks to the script as well.

All of the configuration is in the config.php file. For some options you can override the config.php by sending hidden form fields.

I've written variations of the script for different projects and finally tried to consolidate everything into one configurable script.

If you use this and have questions or improvments please let me know.
